#+title: Armin Hofmann Graphic Design Manual Summer Project
#+author: Ashley Sagar


* WHAT EVEN IS THIS PROJECT?

This is my self imposed summer project to work through the Armin
Hofman Graphic Design Manual to try and give myself some grounding in graphic design. I will be making all of the work in the Processing app and also porting some work over to P5 so I  can build a web portfolio alongside this.

I will attempt to add in programming techniques along the way by going back over the workshops in creative coding 1 class I had whilst in my first term studying my MFA in Computational Arts at Goldsmiths University.

I will work through the examples and make them availiable on a Patreon whilst sharing my own creations on my [[https://www.instagram.com/green.road.studios/][green.road.studios]]



* Things to do
- [X] make a github
- [ ] load images and pde files into git
- [ ] rename sketches to be in accordance with the sketch numbers in the book
